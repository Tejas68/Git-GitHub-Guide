**1.1 What is Git?**



Git is a Version Control System (VCS).



A Version Control System helps you:



Track changes in files



Go back to previous versions



Work with a team without overwriting each other's work



Manage code history safely



Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for managing the development of the Linux kernel.

**1.3 How Git Works (Core Concept)**



Git works in three main areas:



&nbsp;Working Directory



This is your project folder.



&nbsp;Staging Area (Index)



This is where you prepare changes before saving.



&nbsp;Repository (.git folder)



This stores the full history of your project.


**Simple Flow: Working Directory → Staging Area → Repository**



**Each commit = a saved version of your project.**


**Download \& Install Git from** [**https://git-scm.com/**](Git)


**Check version after Installing Git:
git --version**




**First-Time Setup
Git needs your identity:**


**git config --global user.name "Your Name"**

**git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

Check config:**

**git config --list**
